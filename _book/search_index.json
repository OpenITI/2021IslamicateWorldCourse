In this exciting, new project-based course, students from both institutions will come together to learn the basics of computational textual analysis while participating as student researchers in the nascent project of exploring the vast and largely unexplored tomes of textual data about the Islamicate world. It will also introduce students to theoretical and methodological debates in the field of global digital humanities. Like the digital humanities field that inspires its approach, it will be a highly interdisciplinary course that studies texts from multiple genres (lyric poetry to historical chronicles, legal treatises to the Quran) and languages (Arabic, Persian) with the aid of computational textual analysis tools. There are no language prerequisites, but it is preferable if students at least have elementary knowledge of either Arabic, Persian, Turkish, or Urdu. 1.2 Virtual Classroom This course will be conducted over Zoom. The Zoom link will be provided to you in the course email group. 1.3 Instructors 1.3.1 Dr. Jonathan Parkes Allen Office Hours: by appointment E-mail: jallen22@umd.edu Roshan Institute for Persian Studies University of Maryland, College Park Bio: Jonathan Parkes Allen is the Mellon Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow for the Open Islamicate Texts Initiative Arabic-script OCR Catalyst Project (OpenITI AOCP). He is a historian of early modern and medieval Islamicate history, with particular interests in the history of religious practice and thought in the Ottoman Empire as well as the application of digital methods to the study of global Islamicate history at scale. His current research focuses on Islamicate sainthood, devotion, and ritual, as well as the historical evolution of Arabic script and typography. Visit his website for more on his ongoing research interests. 1.3.2 Dr. Matthew Thomas Miller Office Hours: by appointment E-mail: mtmiller@umd.edu Roshan Institute for Persian Studies University of Maryland, College Park Bio: Matthew Thomas Miller, PhD. is Assistant Professor of Persian Literature and Digital Humanities at Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park and and an affiliate of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities. He also serves as the Director of the Roshan Initiative in Persian Digital Humanities (PersDig@UMD) and as the co-PI for the multi-institutional Open Islamicate Texts Initiative (OpenITI) and the Persian Manuscript Initiative (PMI). He has received funding for these projects from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and The National Endowment for the Humanities. His research focuses on medieval Sufi literature, the history of sexuality and the body, and digital humanities. He currently is working on a book project, entitled Beautiful Bodies: Embodiment and Mystical Modes of Meaning Creation in Medieval Persian Sufi Literature, and a number of articles on computational or distant reading approaches to Persian literature and carnivalesque Sufi poetry. See his website for more details. 1.3.3 Dr. Sarah Bowen Savant Office Hours: by appointment E-mail: sarah.savant@aku.edu AKU ISMC, 10 Handyside Street, Kings Cross, London N1C 4DN Bio: At the AKU-ISMC, Professor Savant is a cultural historian working on the history and historiography of the Middle East and Iran up to 1400. She is the co-Principal Investigator, with Matthew Miller and Maxim Romanov, of the OpenITI, and the PI of the KITAB project, which focuses on Arabic book history using digital methods, especially text reuse detection. Her books include The New Muslims of Post-Conquest Iran: Tradition, Memory, and Conversion (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013) and The Excellence of the Arabs: A Translation of Ibn Qutaybahs Fal al-Arab wa l-tanbh al ulmih (with Peter Webb; The Library of Arabic Literature; Abu Dhabi: New York University Press, 2016) as well as articles and edited volumes on history writing, cultural memory, and the formation of identities. Her current book project - entitled A Cultural History of the Arabic Book - explores how the reuse of earlier texts helped to shape the historic tradition from its formative days onwards, as well as how authors conceived of their work and the very meaning of the book itself. 1.3.4 Dr. Peter Verkinderen Office Hours: by appointment E-mail: peter.verkinderen@aku.edu AKU ISMC, 10 Handyside Street, Kings Cross, London N1C 4DN Bio: Peter Verkinderen is a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at KITAB working on the central regions of the Islamic lands. He studied Classics and Arabic and Islamic studies at Ghent University. His PhD dissertation, also at Ghent University, was a reconstruction of the fluvial landscape of early Islamic Lower Mesopotamia, based on (mostly Arabic) texts, satellite imagery and data from archaeological and geological research. He has worked as the assistant director of the Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo (2009-2014) and as a research fellow in the ERC project The Early Islamic Empire at Work (Hamburg University, 2014-2019), where he focussed on the position of Frs (SW Iran) in the early Islamic empire. His main research interests lie with the historical and geographical literature on the early Islamic empire. In recent years, the development of digital tools for historical and philological research has become one of his main interests. He is currently also involved in IslamAtlas, a research project aimed at the study and digital edition of the geographical texts and maps usually attributed to al-Iakhr and Ibn awqal. 1.4 Required texts and technologies Arnold, Taylor and Lauren Tilton.

This course requires extensive use of a computer. 1.5 Learning objectives By the end of this course students will have: become acquainted with the major debates and tools in computational textual studies; developed intermediate-level skills in the R programming language; gained extensive experience working in international teams (termed collaboratories here) to solve complex problems; produced a mini-research publication that will be published on the course site (with the students permission). 1.6 Expectations and grading procedures The grade breakdown for this class is as follows (and see more details on each element in subsections below): 20% Participation 10% Co-discussion Leading 20% Class Assignments 40% Final (Group) Project 10% Class (Group) Presentation All grades will be posted on the course ELMS page. If you would like to review any of your grades, or have questions about how something was scored, please email me to schedule a time for us to meet and discuss. I am happy to discuss any of your grades with you, and if we have made a mistake we will immediately correct it. Any formal grade disputes must be submitted in writing and within one week of receiving the grade. Final letter grades are assigned based on the percentage of total assessment points earned. To be fair to everyone I have to establish clear standards and apply them consistently, so please understand that being close to a cutoff is not the same as making the cut (89.99  90.00). It would be unethical to make exceptions for some and not others. If you think you are very close to a cut-off point and would like the higher grade, please contact me about extra credit opportunities. 1.6.1 Final Grade Cutoffs + 97.00% + 87.00% + 77.00% + 67.00% + A 93.00% B 84.00% C 74.00% D 64.00% F &lt;60.0% - 90.00% - 80.00% - 70.00% - 60.00% - 1.6.2 Participation (20%) Students will be expected to come to class ready to discuss each text or technical training exercises in depth. Class participation is very important. However, please note, it is the quality of participation that We are interested innot quantity. Again, we cannot stress enough how important your regular attendance and active participation in class discussion is for your grade (for attendance policy, see #1 in the Course Procedures and Policies section below). If you have questions about your grade in this area, please visit me in office hours or schedule a time to come meet with me to discuss. 1.6.3 Co-discussion Leading (10%) You will be asked to serve as co-discussion leaders (alongside the instructors) on a rotating basis for the sessions in which we have specific assigned readings. You will be responsible for introducing and contextualizing the readings for the class and formulating class discussion questions based on the readings. 1.6.4 Class Assignments (20%) Beginning in the ninth week of the semester, you will be assigned specific assignments to complete in R. These assignments will be posted in ELMS and they must be turned in before class time in order to receive credit. 1.6.5 Final (Group) Project (40%) (and the Research Collaboratories) This course is a project-based learning course. The final project, therefore, will occupy a substantial amount of our class time throughout the semester and will be a major component of your final grade. But, fear not! The instructors will work closely with each of you and your groups to construct a collaborative research project. You will spend much of the second half of the course working on this project during class time with your fellow group members in the research collaboratory groups that we will form in week 11. At the conclusion of each research collaboratory session, each student will take on an assignment, which must be completed before the next class period. These will be reported to the instructors after class so they can keep track of each individuals contributions to the project and grade them on these weekly assignments. These tasks will vary greatly on the basis of each groups project: some students may be working on cleaning and/or reformatting texts, others on developing a R script, and still others may be tasked with doing traditional humanities research in order to properly contextualize the results of the groups new computational textual analysis. We do not expect that you will have all of the answers when you begin work on your final project. You will need to play and experiment with the texts and different modes of textual analysis and visualization available to you in R, and you certainly will hit dead ends and completely fail (productively) at times too. In this process, however, you will learn a great deal, as the research on experiential and problem/project-based learning has shown. We will guide you throughout your work on the final project, making sure that it eventually comes together to form a micro-publication by the end of the course. You will present on and submit your final projects on the assigned exam day for this course, May 18th by 6:00pm. 1.6.6 Class presentation (10%) Your class presentation is an opportunity for you to present your groups final project to the class. It should be between 20-30 minutes in length. You should provide an overview of your initial hypothesis, methods of analysis, problems you encountered in your research, and your research findings (including, how they corroborate or problematize the existing scholarly narratives). You will be graded on the quality of both your research and presentation of it. You will present on your final project sometime around May 18th (we will mutually determine a time for class presentations based on everyones availability and timezone restrictions). 1.7 Faculty-student communication Faculty and advisors use email to convey important information. Students are responsible for keeping their email address up to date. Failure to check email or errors in forwarding are the responsibility of the student, and do not constitute an excuse for missing announcements or deadlines. For better or for worse, in the modern digital world, it is a necessity that you check your email at least a few times per day (during regular work hours) and respond promptly to messages. I would suggest checking messages in the morning and late afternoon at the minimum. 1.8 Emergency protocol This course will be conducted via Zoom. 1.9 Course schedule 1.9.1 Week 1: Class Introduction and Introduction to Computational Textual Analysis 1/28/2021 Thursday [NB: Keep in mind that dates below are given according to the American convention: Month/Day/Year] Prepare for Class: Underwood, Ted.

Consistent attendance offers students the most effective opportunity to gain command of course concepts and materials. Students who miss class without an excused absence will receive a 0% for that days participation grade. Events that justify an excused absence include: religious observances; mandatory military obligation; illness of the student or illness of an immediate family member; participation in university activities at the request of university authorities; and compelling circumstances beyond the students control (e.g., death in the family, required court appearance). Absences stemming from work duties other than military obligation (e.g., unexpected changes in shift assignments) and traffic/transit problems do not typically qualify for excused absence. Students claiming an excused absence must notify the course instructor in a timely manner and provide appropriate documentation. The notification should be provided either prior to the absence or as soon afterwards as possible. In the case of religious observances, athletic events, and planned absences known at the beginning of the semester, the student must inform the instructor during the schedule adjustment period. All other absences must be reported as soon as is practical. The student must provide appropriate documentation of the absence. The documentation must be provided in writing to the instructor. The full university attendance/absence policy can be found here. * As long as COVID-19 persists, we will be willing to make exceptions to these general rules on a case-by-case basis. Please discuss with me concerns you have about attendance and we can develop alternative plans, if necessary. 1.10.2 Academic Integrity: The Universitys Code of Academic Integrity is designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty and integrity are upheld. In accordance with this code, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please ensure that you fully understand this code and its implications because all acts of academic dishonesty will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this code. All students are expected to adhere to this Code. It is your responsibility to read it and know what it says, so you can start your professional life on the right path. It is important to note that course assistance websites, such as CourseHero, are not permitted sources, unless the instructor explicitly gives permission for you to use one of these sites. Material taken or copied from these sites can be deemed unauthorized material and a violation of academic integrity. These sites offer information that might not be accurate and that shortcut the learning process, particularly the critical thinking steps necessary for college-level assignments. Additionally, it is understandable that students may use a variety of online or virtual forums for course-wide discussion (e.g., GroupME or WeChat). Collaboration in this way regarding concepts discussed in this course is permissible. However, collaboration on graded assignments is strictly prohibited unless otherwise stated. Examples of prohibited collaboration include: asking classmates for answers on quizzes or exams, asking for access codes to clicker polls, etc. Finally, on each exam or assignment you must write out and sign the following pledge: I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this exam/assignment. Please visit the Office of Undergraduate Studies full list of campus-wide policies and follow up with me if you have questions. 1.10.3 Accessibility and Disability Support: The University of Maryland is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive educational, working, and living environment for people of all abilities. The University of Maryland is also committed to the principle that no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the University, or be subjected to discrimination. The Accessibility &amp; Disability Service (ADS) provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals to provide equal access to services, programs and activities. ADS cannot assist retroactively, so it is generally best to request accommodations several weeks before the semester begins or as soon as a disability becomes known. Any student who needs accommodations should contact me as soon as possible so that I have sufficient time to make arrangements. For assistance in obtaining an accommodation, contact Accessibility and Disability Service at 301-314-7682, or email them at adsfrontdesk@umd.edu. Information about sharing your accommodations with instructors, note taking assistance and more is available from the Counseling Center. 1.10.4 Copyright Notice: Class lectures and other materials are protected by a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license. Copyright infringements may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. 1.10.5 Academic Accommodations for Students Who Experience Sexual Misconduct: The University of Maryland is committed to providing support and resources, including academic accommodations, for students who experience sexual or relationship violence as defined by the Universitys Sexual Misconduct Policy. To report an incident and/or obtain an academic accommodation, contact the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct at 301-405-1142. If you wish to speak confidentially, contact Campus Advocates Respond and Educate (CARE) to Stop Violence at 301-741-3555. As responsible university employees faculty are mandatory reporters and are required to report any disclosure of sexual misconduct, i.e., they may not hold such disclosures in confidence. More information can be found here. 1.10.6 Diversity: The University of Maryland values the diversity of its student body. Along with the University, the instructor(s) are committed to providing a classroom atmosphere that encourages the equitable participation of all students regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation. Potential devaluation of students in the classroom that can occur by reference to demeaning stereotypes of any group and/or overlooking the contributions of a particular group to the topic under discussion is inappropriate and will not be tolerated. 1.10.7 Faculty-Student Communication: Faculty and advisors use email and ELMS to convey important information, and students are responsible for keeping their email address up to date, and must ensure that forwarding to another address functions properly. Failure to check email, errors in forwarding, and returned email are the responsibility of the student, and do not constitute an excuse for missing announcements or deadlines. In the modern digital world, it is a necessity that students check email and other forms of digital communication (e.g., ELMS) at least a few times per day and respond promptly to messages. I would suggest checking messages in the morning and evening at the minimum. 1.10.8 Emergency Protocol: This course is conducted via Zoom. 1.10.9 Forms of Address (Names and Pronouns) and Self-Identification: Our institutions official policy states that The University of Maryland recognizes that name and gender identity are central to most individuals sense of self and well-being, and that it is important for the University to establish mechanisms to acknowledge and support individuals self-identification. One way we can support self-identification is by honoring the name and pronouns that each of us go by. Many people (e.g. international students, performers/writers, trans people, and others) might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this classroom, we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by. Pronouns can be a way to affirm someones gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to a persons identity. They are simply a public way in which people are referred to in place of their name (e.g., he or she or they or ze or something else). In this classroom, you are invited (if you want to) to share what pronouns you go by, and we seek to refer to people using the pronouns that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity. Visit please visit the following links to learn more about gender identity and pronouns: https://lgbt.umd.edu/rainbow-terrapin-network-transterps and https://lgbt.umd.edu/good-practices-names-and-pronouns. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity, is your choice whether to disclose (e.g., should it come up in classroom conversation about our experiences and perspectives) and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly and will support you in doing so as well. 1.10.10 Statement in Support of Students with Children: We welcome and support students who are parents. We appreciate that parenthood presents unique challenges and demands on a students time and availability. If childcare constraints present an issue with class attendance, we invite student parents to work with us to discuss alternate arrangements. We also welcome and support pregnant students and will provide possible accommodations and discuss arrangements so that students can complete course requirements. 1.10.11 Communication with Peers: With a diversity of perspectives and experience, we may find ourselves in disagreement and/or debate with one another. As such, it is important that we agree to conduct ourselves in a professional manner and that we work together to foster and preserve a virtual classroom environment in which we can respectfully discuss and deliberate controversial questions. We encourage you to confidently exercise your right to free speechbearing in mind, of course, that you will be expected to craft and defend arguments that support your position. Keep in mind, that free speech has its limit and this course is NOT the space for hate speech, harassment, and derogatory language. We will make every reasonable attempt to create an atmosphere in which each student feels comfortable voicing their argument without fear of being personally attacked, mocked, demeaned, or devalued. Any behavior (including harassment, sexual harassment, and racially and/or culturally derogatory language) that threatens this atmosphere will not be tolerated. Please alert us immediately if you feel threatened, dismissed, or silenced at any point during our semester together and/or if your engagement in discussion has been in some way hindered by the learning environment. 1.10.12 Student Resources and Academic Services: Taking personal responsibility for you own learning means acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and doing something about it. We hope you will come talk to me so that we can help you find the right approach to success in this course, and we encourage you to visit UMDs Student Academic Support Services website to learn more about the wide range of campus resources available to you. In particular, everyone can use some help sharpen their communication skills (and improving their grade) by visiting UMDs Writing Center and schedule an appointment with the campus Writing Center. You should also know there are a wide range of resources to support you with whatever you might need (UMDs Student Resources and Services website may help). If you feel it would be helpful to have someone to talk to, visit UMDs Counseling Center or one of the many other mental health resources on campus. 1.10.13 Basic Needs Security: Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in this course, is encouraged to use the resources listed below for support and visit UMDs Division of Student Affairs website for more information. Students are better served and supported when such circumstances are shared with the professor. Please consider sharing your situation with your professor who may be able to assist you in finding the appropriate resources. Campus Pantry: Alleviates food insecurity and provides a safe space to distribute emergency food to current UMD students. The Campus Pantry is located in the Health Center, Heilsa Room 0143 (Ground Floor), and is open each Friday during the semester from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Individual appointments are also available.

Logging into eScriptorium You log into eScriptorium with an individual account made up of a login, a password and an email address. An account is created by the user after receiving an invitation or by the site administrator: Overview of the connection interface, where you enter your login and password before clicking on \"login\". Login form Once logged on, you will see the dashboard which allows you to manage all the documents created by and shared with the account. On first login, this dashboard is empty: Dashboard preview, empty 3.3.4.2 1.2. Create a new document 3.3.4.2.1 1.2.1. Point terminology A \"document\" is a collection of images forming a whole unit; A \" document-part\" is an image--a page belonging to a document. 3.3.4.2.2 1.2.2. Instructions To create a document, click on the Create new button; a new page is displayed as well as an input form: Document description tab The document \"description\" tab is where you fill in the metadata. The \"Name\" field is mandatory. The others are optional and can be completed later. We will come back to the Ontology section later. Once the information has been entered, click on Create to create the document; a message is then displayed: \"Document created successfully!\" You can still modify the data entered: the \"Create\" button has been replaced by an \"Update\" button. Access the document editing interface from the dashboard. To return to this form from the dashboard, click on the Edit icon in front of the document. 3.3.4.3 1.3. Upload images 3.3.4.3.1 1.3.1. Access the interface The Images interface is used to manage most of the tasks related to automatic image processing and imports and exports. To access the image loading interface, click on the Images tab. Navigation between the \"Description\" and \"Images\" tabs. There are several ways to import images to the platform. 3.3.4.3.2 1.3.2. Import local files Simply load the files using drag-and-drop or click in the box to open the file explorer. Note: you must wait until all the images are loaded before refreshing the page! How to import images from the local file system. 3.3.4.3.3 1.3.3. Import images from PDF file Click on the Import button, then Images (PDF) option to load a PDF file and automatically extract the images. Please note, only the images are imported. If the PDF contains a text layer corresponding to the transcription, it is not imported. demonstration of importing images from a PDF 3.3.4.3.4 1.3.4. Use an IIIF manifesto Click on the Import button, then the Images (IIIF) option, then enter the url of an IIIF manifesto. All the images associated with the manifesto are then copied locally, as well as the metadata, which is visible in the Description tab. Example: https://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b53026595r/manifest.json Demonstration of importing images through an IIIF manifesto. 3.3.4.4 1.4. Manually annotate documents 3.3.4.4.1 1.4.1. Access the interface Manual annotation is necessary to generate ground truth data used to train models, or to correct the result of these operations. It can also be used as part of an annotation campaign that does not make use of Kraken models (eScriptorium only serves as an input environment). The document-parts edit tab allows you to create or modify annotation elements manually. It is accessed by clicking on the Edit tab at the top of the page or by clicking on the Edit button on each map representing a part-document. There are several viewing panes in this tab corresponding to each possible editing task. Several visualization panes can be activated within the \"Edit\" tab Click on the \"Edit\" button on each card representing a part-document Another way to access the \"Edit\" tab \"Image source\" allows you to display the source image; Segmentation displays the segmentation editing pane; \"Transcription\" displays the editing pane of the transcription in diplomatic view; \"Text\" is used to display the editing pane of the transcription in text mode. Enabling and disabling edit panes 3.3.4.4.2 1.4.2. Annotate segments and areas on the image The segment editing pane allows you to perform several essential operations: Drawing baselines corresponding to the locations of the text on the image in two ways: Free route (not recommended); Point by point plot. Adding points on a line (select it then double-click at the point's location); Moving one or more point (s) by a simple select-drag; Deleting one or more point (s) on a line; Cutting one or more lines using the scissors tool; Joining one or more lines; Configuring the reading direction of a line; Activating the calculation of the polygons associated with each line (this task is automatic and managed asynchronously without any action on the part of the user after the first use). In this pane, it is also possible to create regions (or zones ) and associate segments to them. A segment located within the perimeter of a region is therefore not automatically associated with it. All the operations that can be carried out in this pane are detailed in a help window (to display it, click on \"?\"). It will thus be noted that there are many shortcuts making it possible to simplify all these operations. 3.3.4.4.3 1.4.3. Annotate the transcript Only when there are segments and masks on the image is it possible to use the functionalities of the Transcription and Text tabs. To add or modify a transcription associated with a segment from the Transcription pane, click on the corresponding zone. An input window is displayed. To record a transcription, press Enter: the transcription interface automatically displays the input field for the next segment. As you type in the Transcription pane, the crenellated areas are replaced by text and the content of the Text pane changes. It is therefore also possible to modify the text from the Text pane and even to copy and paste several lines at once. Manually edit the transcription from the \"Transcription\" pane. 3.3.4.4.4 1.4.4. A note on the articulation of baselines, polygons and transcriptions** The baseline is the central element for storing information in the eScriptorium database. So : It is possible to modify a baseline (remove / move / add points) without impacting the transcription; The polygon is always calculated from the baseline, including during training It is possible to modify the polygon manually (not recommended) without this impacting the transcription. During the training of the Kraken models, the calculation of the polygons is reset: the user therefore has an interest in not intervening on the polygons and on the contrary to ensure that the baselines are drawn in such a way that the automatically generated polygons are correct. . Moreover, when manually entering ground truth data, care should be taken to transcribe only what is inside the polygon. 3.3.4.4.5 1.4.5. Changing the order of segments The playback order of the segments is calculated automatically. You can display the order number of each segment from the Segmentation pane by clicking on Toggle ordering display (L) or from the Text pane where the lines are displayed in the following order. It is possible to modify this order from the Text pane by clicking Toggle sorting mode. A simple drag and drop of the lines is then enough to carry out the modification. Note: it is advisable to ensure the quality of the segmentation before changing the order of the lines because adding or deleting lines systematically restarts the calculation of this order, overwriting manual modifications in the process. Edit the order of the segments from the Text pane 3.3.4.4.6 1.4.6. Semantic annotation It is possible to associate labels (or tags ) with segments and regions by following an ontology pre-defined by the user from the Description tab. There are default tags , but it is possible to add some using the input fields (click on \"+\" then \"Update\" to add the new tag to the list) or to delete (uncheck the box in front of the tag then click on \"Update\"). From the Segmentation pane, select an area or a segment, then click on Set the type on all selected lines / regions (T) and choose the appropriate tag . The color of the area or line changes. It is possible to apply a tag to several regions or segments at once: all you have to do is select several (Ctrl + click-drag or keep Ctrl pressed and click the targeted segments / regions). Add elements in the ontology from the \"Description\" pane then apply the tags to the segments / regions from the \"Edit\" pane. 3.3.4.5 1.5. Import annotations 3.3.4.5.1 1.5.1. Import structured annotations in XML It is possible to import segments and / or a transcript generated outside of eScriptorium. To do this, in the Images tab, click on the Import / Transcription (XML) option. A form appears allowing you to specify a name to identify the version to import and to load the file to import. This can be an ALTO XML file, a PAGE XML file or a ZIP containing several ALTO or PAGE XML files. It is not necessary to select beforehand which document-parts are concerned by the import: the link is made automatically according to the information contained in the XML files. Form for configuring segmentation and / or transcription imports Please note, after importing segments generated without Kraken / eScriptorium, it is essential to reset the polygons ( masks ) before using these documents to train a transcription model. 3.3.4.5.2 1.5.2. Import annotations from plain text It is possible to manually import a transcription from a plain text version using the Text pane of the Edit tab. Each line break then indicates the passage to a new segment. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the reading order of the lines matches. 3.3.4.6 1.6. Automatically annotate documents 3.3.4.6.1 1.6.1. Instructions Automatic document annotation is managed from the Images tab. Select the images to annotate; Click on Segment (for the detection of baselines, polygons and / or areas) or on Transcribe (for transcription); A form is displayed: it allows you to load a Kraken model or to use a model already available in eScriptorium and, for segmentation, to configure the annotation. 3.3.4.6.2 1.6.2. Setting up segmentation \"Segmentation steps\" allows you to manage what level of segmentation is carried out: Line and Regions leads to the generation of zones (provided that the model used has been trained for this), baselines and associated polygons. Line Baselines and Masks leads to the generation of baselines and associated polygons. \"Only line Masks\" does not require loading a model; this option allows you to reset on the fly the calculation of the polygons associated with the baselines already present on the images. Regions makes it possible to keep intact the baselines and polygons already present on the images and to generate only the zones. \"Text direction\" is used to indicate the reading direction of the lines. Overview of the options available in the automatic segmentation configuration form. 3.3.4.7 1.7. Train models 3.3.4.7.1 1.7.1. Start a workout Training of Kraken models is started from the Images tab; it is tracked from the Models tab (inactive as long as no model other than the default model is associated with the document). Access to training functions may be subject to authorization. It is managed from the administration interface. To train a model, all the mobilized images / annotations must be in the same document. Select the share documents containing the ground truth; Click on \"Train\" then select the type of model to train: \"Segment\" for a segmentation model, \"Recognizer\" for a transcription model; Fill out the form then click on \"Train\"; The training task is started, sometimes you have to wait before this is displayed. When the training is finished, the user receives a notification and can access the final model from the Models tab. It is then possible to download the model or use it on the document. 3.3.4.7.2 1.7.2. Refine a model or start from scratch? The training configuration form allows you to choose: If you want to start from scratch (simply indicate the name to give to the new model that will be created); Or if you want to refine a model (it can be loaded from the file manager, or be already present in the list of models associated with the current document). Caution: in version 0.6.9, modifying the name of the model to train is only taken into account in the case of a model starting from zero. In order not to overwrite an already existing model, make sure to download the model locally, rename it according to the name desired for the new model, then load it into eScriptorium from the form. 3.3.4.8 1.8. Export annotations The export of annotations is carried out from the Images tab. Select the relevant part-documents; Click on \"Export\" then fill out the form: Specify the version of the transcription to export; Specify the export format (\"Alto\" for XML ALTO, \"Pagexml\" for XML PAGE, or \"Text\" for plain text); Check \"Include Images\" if you also want to export the images; Click on Export and save the generated ZIP file. 3.3.5 2. Manage a collaborative annotation campaign 3.3.5.1 2.1. Create a user group (admin) It is possible to create user groups from the administrator's dashboard (provided you have the associated rights). These groups are used to define work teams or to assign certain rights to a set of users. It will soon be possible for a user with sufficient rights to create a team and invite other users to it. 3.3.5.2 2.2. Share a document with another user or with a group A user can share a document with multiple users, including outside of the group (s) to which it belongs. From the \"Description\" tab: Click on the \"Share\" button Enter the name of the user with whom to share the document, or check his name in the list that appears To confirm, click on \"Share\" Share a document with a group or a user. 3.3.5.3 2.3. Share a template with another user or with a group A template is associated with a document and not with a user. To share a model with another user, there are two possibilities: Download the model from the Models tab and send the model via another exchange system (e-mails, etc.); Share with the user the document to which the template is associated. It is then up to the other user to download the model and then load it into the document where he wishes to apply it.

Regular expressions exercises Introduction to using EditPad Pro. 6.1 Regular expressions Regular expressions is a formal language that can be used to describe patterns in strings (a string is a sequence of characters, what we humanists would loosely call text). Regular expressions are especially useful for creating complex search and replace operations. For example, there are many ways to transcribe the Arabic name Muammad in Latin script. The regular expression (or short, regex) M[uo]hammad matches both Muhammad and Mohammad: the square brackets tell the computer that between M and hammad we will accept a u or an o. The same device can be used to build a regex that can match many more transcriptions of Muammad: M[uo][h]am+[ae]d (here we used also the operator + to indicate that the letter m may appear one or more times). Regular expressions are easy to learn (the language uses only 14 special characters: .+*?^$()[]{}|\\), very useful for textual research and a good introduction to formal computer languages. A very good way to learn regular expressions is through the short regex tutorial at Regexone.com. Please go through lessons 1-14 (last lesson: Its all conditional) to prepare for class. We will do some exercises in class, so please come prepared! NB: each lesson takes only 2-3 minutes, and contains a short introduction and an elucidating exercise. You should be able to complete the tutorial in about 30-40 minutes (20 if you have already some experience with regular expressions). 6.1.1 Useful resources regular-expressions.info: detailed tutorial for regular expressions, with a lot of background, by one of the regex gurus, Jan Goyvaerts rexegg.com cheatsheet: a list of all special characters and devices used in regular expressions, with examples. Using this is not cheating! 6.2 Installing EditPad Pro For dealing with digitized text in Islamicate languages, we need a text editor that can handle right-to-left languages well, and can deal with the sometimes very large texts in the pre-modern written tradition. Our text editor of choice is EditPad Pro, which in addition to the two characteristics above, has a number of other powerful features that are very useful for searching, annotating and analyzing texts. One of the most useful features is that you can develop your own highlighting schema for your texts; for texts in the OpenITI corpus, for example, we have developed a schema that highlights the different levels of sections in a different colour, allowing the reader to easily navigate the text. The texts can also be folded to show only those headers, creating a table of contents. You can download the free version of the software (EditPad Pro 8) here: https://download.jgsoft.com/editpad/SetupEditPadProDemo.exe. This is a trial version, but is fully functional for our needs. NB: EditPad Pro works on Windows only. If you use a Mac or Linux computer, you can still run the program using an emulator software like Wine (whinehq.org), which makes it possible to use Windows programs on Mac and Linux. For Mac, see: https://wiki.winehq.org/MacOS. Alternatively, you can install a virtual machine on your computer that runs Windows: Parallels (commercial): https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/ VirtualBox (free): https://www.virtualbox.org/ 6.2.1 Installing the OpenITI highlighting schema Once you have downloaded and installed EditPad Pro, take the following steps to install the OpenITI mARkdown schema (see https://github.com/OpenITI/mARkdown_scheme for more detail): VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure that EditPad Pro is fully closed. Do not close it using the X in the upper right corner (which will not fully close the program) but go to file &gt; exit in Edit Pad Pro. Download the schema from here Unzip the downloaded file. Open the unzipped folder, and copy all of the files in it Within the unzipped folder, double click on the link __Follow_this_link_to_paste_mARkdownScheme8.lnk. This link takes you to the location where EditPad Pro was installed on your computer (%APPDATA%\\JGsoft\\EditPad Pro 8) Paste the files into this folder Now, open EditPadPro. If you have done everything correctly, the background in EditPadPro should be of yellowish color. If the background is still white, you need to repeat the whole procedure; now, make absolutely sure to shut down EditPadPro (not just click on the x in the top right corner, but shut it down through FILE &gt; Exit), then repeat all steps from the beginning of this section. Try opening an OpenITI file to see the highlighing scheme in action. E.g., download the OpenITI/Shamela version of al-Iakhrs Kitb al-Mamlik wa-al-mamlik from here by right-clicking on the file 0346Istakhri.MasalikWaMamalik.Shamela0011680-ara1.mARkdown, and choosing Save link as; then open the saved document in EditPad Pro.
