# week 6: Interacting with the OpenITI Corpus Using Github and Kate

***3/4/2021 Thursday***


Prepare for Class:

* **Install** some software we will need: 
    - Install Kate editor and the OpenITImARkdown highlighting scheme for Kate (instructions for Mac and Windows [below](#installing-kate-editor))
    
      NB: **Since our favourite editor EditPad Pro is not supported anymore on 
      the most recent Mac operation systems, we have decided to use another 
      free editor for use in the course that works for Mac, Windows and Linux users alike.**

      **So please install Kate, even if you are a Windows user and have already 
      installed EditPad Pro last week. This will make tutorials much easier...**
    - Install Git and Git Bash (instructions for Mac and Windows [here](#installing-git))
    - Create a GitHub account if you don't have it already: 
    go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for an account (it's free)
* **Complete** the very basic tutorial on using GitHub  [here](#working-with-github).
  
  **NB: to learn anything from a tutorial, you have to do all the steps yourself, not just read it!
  Also, type the commands yourself, do not simply copy them, you will learn much faster this way.**
* **Read** a couple of introductory articles that will give you some very basic 
     background on the tools we are going to use
    - Introduction to the command line: read the first four sections of this tutorial: [http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash)
    
       NB: (optional) A more detailed introduction (and useful list of commands) is available here:
       [https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)
    - Very first introduction to using Github: [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
    - Introduction to using Github from command line:
     [https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6)


In class:

* Introducing the OpenITI corpus
* Downloading OpenITI texts
* annotating texts using the OpenITI mARkdown scheme in Kate editor
* Using GitHub for cooperative project work


## Installing Kate editor

### On Windows

* Download the most recent installation file here:   
  [https://binary-factory.kde.org/view/Windows%2064-bit/job/Kate_Release_win64/](https://binary-factory.kde.org/view/Windows%2064-bit/job/Kate_Release_win64/) ; 
  go to the **Pipeline Kate_Release_win64** section on that page and download the file that ends with `_64-cl.exe`.

* Once the file was downloaded, double-click the installation file and follow the instructions (you can keep all the default settings the installer proposes)
 
* Kate should now be installed on your computer. Proceed to install the OpenITImARkdown highlighting scheme (see below)


### on Mac

* Download the `.dmg` file here: 
  [https://binary-factory.kde.org/view/MacOS/job/Kate_Release_macos/](https://binary-factory.kde.org/view/MacOS/job/Kate_Release_macos/)
  (choose the file that ends with `.dmg`, the other file is a 
  [checksum](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/))

* Once downloaded click on the .dmg file, double click on the “kate” icon or drag it to the Applications folder 

    NB: You will most likely get a message like 

    ```
    “kate” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software. 
    This software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information.
    ``` 

    This is because recent Mac instances do not allow you to install apps from non-verified developers. There is however a way to override this security measure:
    - Go to “system preferences” => “security & privacy” => under “general” you will see a note saying `"Kate" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer”
    - click “open anyway”
    - a new pop up will appear where you will have to consent again, and then the app should launch 
    
    The process is generally explained here (+ a shortcut if you’re feeling adventurous):

* Kate should now be installed on your computer. Proceed to install the OpenITImARkdown highlighting scheme (see below).

## Installing the OpenITI mARkdown highlighting scheme for Kate

### On Windows: 

* Download the highlighting scheme `OpenITImARkdown.xml` file by right-clicking on this [link](./2021IslamicateWorldCourse_files/OpenITImARkdown.xml) and choosing "Save link as". 

* In Windows Explorer, go to `C:/Users` and double-click the folder with your user name

* In your user folder, find the folder `AppData`. This folder is sometimes hidden; to make it visible, you may have to go to the "View" tab in Windows Explorer, and check the box next to "Hidden items": 

![make hidden files visible](img/make_hidden_files_visible.png)

* Enter the `AppData` folder, double-click the `Local` folder, and make a new directory in it: `org.kde.syntax-highlighting`

* Within the new `org.kde.syntax-highlighting` folder, create another new folder: `syntax`. The full path to this folder should now be `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\org.kde.syntax-highlighting\syntax`

* Copy the `OpenITImARkdown.xml` file into the newly created `syntac` folder. 

* Close the Kate editor if it was open, and open it again. 

* You should now be able to find the OpenITImARkdown highlighting scheme in the list in the Tools > Highlighting > Markup menu:

And also in the dropdown menu in the bottom right of your Kate screen:

### On Mac: 

(Thanks to John for figuring this out!)

1. Download the highlighting scheme `OpenITImARkdown.xml` file by right-clicking on this [link](./2021IslamicateWorldCourse_files/OpenITImARkdown.xml) and choosing "Save link as". 
2. Open Terminal (see [https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/19/ways-open-terminal-mac/](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/19/ways-open-terminal-mac/))
3. Create new subdirectories in the `~/Library/Application Support` folder by
executing this command:

```
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax"
```

  NB: the quotation marks are essential because there is a space in the path!

4. Assuming the `OpenITImARkdown.xml` file is in the `Downloads` folder: 
execute the following command to copy it to the newly created folder:

```
cp ~/Downloads/OpenITImARkdown.xml "$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax"
```

Alternatively:

2. Open Finder
3. in the Finder menu, choose `Go > Go to folder...`, write `~/Library/Application Support/`, then click `Go`
4. create a new folder using the combination command+shift+n, and call it `org.kde.syntax-highlighting`
5. Move into that folder, and create another subfolder using command+shift+n, called `syntax`
6. Copy the `OpenITImARkdown.xml` file into that folder


Close the Kate editor if it was open, and open it again. 

You should now be able to find the OpenITImARkdown highlighting scheme in the list in the Tools > Highlighting > Markup menu: 

![OpenITImARkdown in Tools menu](img/screenshot_kate_tools_highlighting.png)

And also in the dropdown menu in the bottom right of your Kate screen:
