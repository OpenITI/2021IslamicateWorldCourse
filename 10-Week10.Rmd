Create a new R script file, which you name 'chapter3_<your_name>.R' in the 
`R_exercises/Jockers` folder of the repository we downloaded during class 
(if you were not there: please fork the repository from
https://github.com/OpenITI-Training/R_exercises, and clone it to your local 
machine). In this script file, write the code Jockers describes in Chapter 3, 
and run it yourself.
